# Welcome to SDM4FZI

We're thrilled to have you here and thank you for joining our open-source community on GitHub. This organization is dedicated to fostering collaboration, innovation, and the sharing of knowledge among developers and enthusiasts concerning software-defined manufacturing. This organization was created as part of the SDM4FZI project (Software-defined Manufaturing for the automotive and supplier industry) to publish software created in the project. However, we would really appreciate contributions to the published software. For more information concerning the project, please refer to our [homepage](https://www.sdm4fzi.de/en/).

## About Us

At SDM4FZI, we strive to make production systems software-defined, i.e. all processes in a production can be monitored, analyzed and controllered by software. Our goal is to make production planning and operation easier by using new technologies to overcome historic technological barriers and aim for interoperability. By working together, we aim to build amazing software, solve challenging problems, and make a positive impact in the digitalization of productions.
